# Monitoring and Analysis of Wildfire and Vegetation Loss (work in progress)

This project analyzes the early 2025 California wildfires and their impact on vegetation using remote sensing data, including Sentinel-2 and VIIRS imagery, within the Google Earth Engine (GEE) environment. The analysis covers:

- Fire detection using near real-time VIIRS active fire products
- NDVI analysis to assess pre- and post-fire vegetation health
- Burn severity classification through dNBR computation
- Vegetation loss quantification using image segmentation and thresholding techniques
